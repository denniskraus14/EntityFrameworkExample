# EntityFrameworkExample
A Windows Forms Application that uses Entity Framework to update the database and datatable (displayed in the second tab). 
I am working on adding a feature where the user would be able to input data to the datatable and have that save to the database instead. 
This would give the user a second option to input data without using the form.
